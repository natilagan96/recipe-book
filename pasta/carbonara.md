## Instructions

1. Melt little bit of unsalted butter in a large pan. Add 100g of diced pancetta or smoked bacon into the pan. Cook for 5 minutes until crisp and golden brown. Take them out of the pan and set aside.
2. Meanwhile cook 300g of spaghetti in a large pan of salted, boiling water and cook until al dente.
3. In a separate bowl, beat 2 eggs and add Parmesan cheese, Pecorino cheese and black pepper.
4. Drain the spaghetti and add to the pan where the pancetta was cooked. Stir in the pan. 
5. Turn the heat off and pour the egg mixture over the pasta, stirring well. The heat of the pasta is enough to cook the egg mixture through.
6. Mix in pancetta. Serve warm.
