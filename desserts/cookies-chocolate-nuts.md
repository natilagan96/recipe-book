# Cookie recipe


## Ingredients

- 150 g butter, room temperature
- 100 g sugar
- 130 g brown sugar
- 1 egg
- 200 g all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 0.5 tsp vanilla sugar
- 0.5 tsp flaky salt
- 130 g hazelnuts
- 130 g dark chocolate, roughly chopped


## Instructions

- Beat butter, sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy, then beat in the egg. Mix flour, baking powder, vanilla sugar, and salt together, sift into the dough, and stir well.
- Toast the hazelnuts in a dry, hot pan until the skins start to crack. Rub the nuts in a clean cloth to remove the skins. Then roughly chop the hazelnuts. Chop the chocolate and mix both into the dough.
- Shape the dough into small balls about the size of a golf ball and place them spaced apart on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Press the cookies lightly so they flatten a little.
- Bake in a preheated oven at 175°C (350°F) for 13–15 minutes, until the edges are golden and the center is still soft.
- Let them cool slightly on the baking sheet before transferring to a wire rack.
