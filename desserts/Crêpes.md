# Crêpes ménagères — Simple Pancakes

## Ingredients

- 250 g sifted flour
- 100 g sugar
- 1 pinch of salt
- 3 eggs
- Just under 2/5 liter boiled milk
- Flavoring (orange blossom, rum, kirsch, almond milk, etc.)
- Clarified butter
- Sugar for sprinkling

## Instructions

In a bowl, mix the flour, sugar, and salt. Add the eggs one after another and work them in until a smooth, completely homogeneous batter is formed. Then slowly and in small amounts, add the milk to thin the batter to the desired consistency.

You must prepare this batter at least 2 hours before use and let it rest in a warm place so that a barely noticeable fermentation can begin. Only immediately before using the batter should you mix in the desired aroma.

For cooking, you need a shallow pan (or several), preferably made of cast iron. The pan is brushed with melted, clarified butter (or butter fat) and heated well. Then pour in a portion of the batter, which you distribute thinly in the pan — either by tilting and swirling it (for thicker pancakes) or quickly spreading it with a spatula or special tool (for crêpes).

The thinner, lighter, and more evenly golden-brown (on both sides) the pancakes are, the better they taste. You can flip them with a spatula or toss them in the air in the traditional way — the latter is more a matter of skill than of precise technique.

When the pancakes are done, sprinkle them with sugar and serve on small lace doilies.
